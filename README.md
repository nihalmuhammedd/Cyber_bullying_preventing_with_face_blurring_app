Overview

This project integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision techniques to address online harassment and privacy concerns. It comprises two primary modules:
	1.	Cyberbullying Detection: Utilizes machine learning models to analyze textual content from social media platforms, identifying instances of cyberbullying based on linguistic patterns and sentiment analysis.
	2.	Face Blurring: Employs real-time face detection algorithms to automatically blur faces in images and videos, ensuring anonymity and protecting individuals’ identities.

Features
	•	Text Analysis: Implements NLP techniques to process and classify user-generated content.
	•	Real-Time Face Detection: Detects and blurs faces in multimedia content using OpenCV and deep learning models.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive GUI for users to interact with both modules seamlessly.
